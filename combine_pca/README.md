#### Setup

Setup is very simple.

1. Install Python dependencies from requirements.txt
2. Navigate to https://bit.io/bitdotio/nfl_combine/ and click connect for an API key
    - You will have to create a free account to get an API key if you are not an existig bit.io user
3. Insert the API key where specified at the top of the notebook.
    - Caution: if you intend to share the notebook, you should put the API key in a non-shared file or in an environment variable instead of hard-coded into the notebook.
