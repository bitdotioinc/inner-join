# Setup

The easiest way to run this notebook is from [Deepnote](link to DN notebook).

Otherwise,
1. Install the python dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file.
2. If you don't yet have a [bit.io](https://bit.io/) account, create one. It only takes a minute!
3. Run the first code cell in the notebook. You will be prompted for an API key. You can get your API key by logging into bit.io, scrolling down to the "Connect any data tool" box, clicking on "API/SDK", and copying the key from there.
